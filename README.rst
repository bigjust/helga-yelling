helga-yelling
===========

Responds to yelling with yelling.

Shamelessy, but hopefully not illegally, stolen from [A Really Fun(tm) Hayt plugin](https://github.com/desert-planet/hayt/blob/master/scripts/loud.coffee). Essentially encourages yelling because yells get saved and responded to with random yells it remembers.
